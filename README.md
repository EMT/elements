Elements for Styling
====================

A basic set of semantic elements used as a base for project style guides.

## Quick Cheat Sheet

Here’s a quick list of elements (as styled by Github):

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

> This is a block quote

--

> # This is also a blockquote
>
> This blockquote has different types of content within it. A heading, some paragraph text, and a list:
>
> - Item 1
> - Item 2
> - Item 3

- This is item 1 in a bulleted list
- This is item 2
- And this is item 3

1. This is item 1 in a numbered list
2. This is item 2
3. And this is item 3

Text can have *italics*, **bold bits** and [Hyperlinks to other places](http://madebyfieldwork.com)

## More Info

Here’s more detail about how they’re used:

### Headings

#### H1: First level heading

Main heading, usually only used once on a page, and usually the page title.

#### H2: Second level heading

A sub-heading, usually used to title sections within a page. Can be used multiple times on a page.

#### H3-6: Lower level headings

H3 is usually enough, but headings can go down to a sixth-level.

### Blockquotes

A blockquote is quoted content. It can contain pretty much any content (headings, lists, paragraphs, etc.) and is usually used for things like pull quotes or citations from other sources.

### Lists & Paras

Lists and paragraphs are pretty self-exaplanitory—see examples above.
